# MCP Server Example

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server using .NET. It provides endpoints for interacting with MCP clients and includes tools for testing and debugging, such as the MCP Inspector. The example also shows how to integrate with external services like GitLab using user secrets for configuration.

## Tools

### AzureTool

- **GetAzureSubscriptionsAsync**: Retrieves a list of Azure subscriptions and their IDs.
- **GetListOfResourceGroupsAsync**: Retrieves a list of Azure resource groups for a given subscription.
- **GetVirtualMachinesMatchTagKeyAsync**: Retrieves all virtual machine names and their tags from a subscription where the VM has a tag that matches a specified tag key.
- **GetResourcesInResourceGroupAsync**: Retrieves all resources within a specified resource group.
- **GetResourcePropertiesAsync**: Retrieves a dictionary of properties and metadata for a specific Azure resource based on its resource ID.

> [!NOTE]
> **Prompts**:
> - retrieve a list of azure subscriptions and their ids
> - retrieve a list of resource groups in ??? 
> - retrieve all the resource ids and types in resource group ???
> - retrieve all the properties and metadata for azure resource ???
> ---
> **Actual prompt**:
> retrieve all resource groups in the developmentsub subscription. For each resource group, retrieve all resources. Cross-check the resource types with those that can integrate with Azure Key Vault. Finally, produce a markdown table that includes the resource group, resource ID, resource name, and resource type.

### WhoIsTool

- **WhoIs**: Provides domain registration and ownership information for a given domain.

### GitLabTools

- **SearchGroupsAsync**: Returns a list of GitLab groups based on a search pattern.
- **GetProjectsInGroupAsync**: Returns a list of projects in a specified GitLab group.
- **GetVariablesInProjectAsync**: Returns a list of variables in a GitLab project, masking variable values if they are set as masked (leaving the last 4 characters visible).

## How to run

>[!NOTE]
> To run the GitLabTool tools it requires both a PAT and a domain. Please follow the instructions [here](#user-secrets)

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

You'll see an output similar to this:

```
Building...
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5168
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Development
```

Copy the Http URL as you'll need this when you run the MCP Inspector (see the next section).


## How to debug/test

If you're not receiving the responses you expect, or if you want to test and interact with your MCP server(s) outside of the VSCode environment, you can use the MCP Inspector. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for testing and debugging your MCP servers. [Access the MCP Inspector source code here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).

To install the inspector, enter this into your terminal:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dotnet run
```

This then starts the MCP Inspector.  Click on the HTTP URL to access the Inspector:

```bash
Starting MCP inspector...
‚öôÔ∏è Proxy server listening on port 6277
üîç MCP Inspector is up and running at http://127.0.0.1:6274 üöÄ
New SSE connection
```

Using the HTTP Url you copied earlier, select the **Transport Type** dropdown and set to `SSE` and paste this into **URL** (please add `/sse` to the end) text box and press the `Connect` button:

To see what tools are available, now press the `List Tools` button (located in the centre of the UI). This will reveal:

Now it's over to you to experiment!

## User Secrets

If the project is missing a `<UserSecretsId>` then run this to setup user secrets for this project:

```
dotnet user-secrets init
```

GitLab PAT

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "GitLab:Token" "<your-token-value>"
```

GitLab Domain

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "GitLab:Domain" "<your-domain-value>"
```
